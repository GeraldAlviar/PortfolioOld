''This is a VBA Macro code snippet for detecting a Microsoft Excel workbook using its file name. You may also use wildcards to enhance workbook detection.
''Useful for repetitive file name unlike the code "Windows("WorkSheetFile.xlsm").Activate" which does rely exactly on the filename provided.
''Example: WorkbookNo, WorkbookNo(1), and WorkbookNo(2). You can use "WorkbookNo*" to detect filename variations. *for wildcard query
''Extra codes are included for cleaning the destination spreadsheet for pasting (ClearWorksheetData) and detecting a modified columns.
